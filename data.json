There's a few extras like a stepped control key, an R4 1.5u Caps Lock, and R3/R4 Pg Up/Dn that'll help you get the exact legends you want on the right keys. One change from R1 is things like the stepped caps lock and num lock getting changed to single-line legends for more consistency. Numpad sublegends have been removed for an overall cleaner look as well. "
